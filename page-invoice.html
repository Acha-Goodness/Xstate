What is the most meaningful community youâ€™ve been a part of? Name it here.
Andela Learning Community
What is your best memory of that community?
My best memory of the community is the physical meet-up organized by the community around various tech location in Lagos, where we get to meet and interact with people of like minds
How well did that community welcome new people?
The best reception i have ever experienced was from that community, once you get accepted into the community they immediately assign a personal mentor that gives you a break down of what the mission, vision and goals of the community are and enlighten you on other matters concerning the community in a bid to help you blend in as fast as possible.
How well did that community create deep bonds between members?
In the community social platform we have different channel for different purposes, one i can remember vividly is the CHIT-CHAT channel where you get to chat with other people and make friends and on that channel the conversation is not restricted to just tech alone there was no restriction of any kind on what to chat on. The facilitators and mentors laid more emphasis on networking and connecting with other developer in the community which was one of the main purpose of the community.
